The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit’s sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. Using Power BI, the analysis will leverage key performance indicators (KPIs) and interactive visualizations to:

- Evaluate overall sales trends and revenue growth.

>**Observation :** Low Fat items account for 64.6% of total sales, while Regular items contribute 35.4%, showing a clear customer preference toward Low Fat products. Blinkit can focus inventory and marketing efforts on Low Fat products to maximize sales, while designing targeted promotions for Regular items to balance demand.


**2. Total Sales by Item Type :**

Objective: Identify the performance of different item types in terms of total sales.<br>
Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.

> ![Sales by Item Type](https://github.com/rishav197/Blinkit-Sales-Analytics-and-Dashboard/blob/main/Plots/sales_by_item_type.png)
>**Observation :** Sales are highly concentrated in a few categories — Fruits & Vegetables (178K) and Snack Foods (175K) lead, followed by Household (136K) and Frozen Foods (118K). Categories like Seafood (9K) and Breakfast (15K) contribute very little. Blinkit can prioritize high-demand categories to sustain revenue growth while considering targeted promotions for low-performing categories to improve overall sales balance.
