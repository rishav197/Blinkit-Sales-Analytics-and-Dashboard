# Blinkit Sales Analytics and Dashboard


## Business Problem :

The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit’s sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. Using Power BI, the analysis will leverage key performance indicators (KPIs) and interactive visualizations to:

- Evaluate overall sales trends and revenue growth.
- Assess customer satisfaction levels and purchasing behavior.
- Analyze inventory distribution and product availability.
- Identify actionable insights and opportunities for business optimization.

This dashboard will enable stakeholders to make data-driven decisions for improving sales efficiency, enhancing customer experience, and optimizing inventory management.

<!-- Charts requirements -->
### 1. Total Sales by Fat Content :

Objective: Analyze the impact of fat content on total sales.<br>
Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.

> ![Sales by Fat Content](https://github.com/rishav197/Blinkit-Sales-Analytics-and-Dashboard/blob/main/Plots/sales_by_fat_content.png)
>**Observation :** Low Fat items account for 64.6% of total sales, while Regular items contribute 35.4%, showing a clear customer preference toward Low Fat products. Blinkit can focus inventory and marketing efforts on Low Fat products to maximize sales, while designing targeted promotions for Regular items to balance demand.


### 2. Total Sales by Item Type :

Objective: Identify the performance of different item types in terms of total sales.<br>
Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.

> ![Sales by Item Type](https://github.com/rishav197/Blinkit-Sales-Analytics-and-Dashboard/blob/main/Plots/sales_by_item_type.png)
>**Observation :** Sales are highly concentrated in a few categories — Fruits & Vegetables (178K) and Snack Foods (175K) lead, followed by Household (136K) and Frozen Foods (118K). Categories like Seafood (9K) and Breakfast (15K) contribute very little. Blinkit can prioritize high-demand categories to sustain revenue growth while considering targeted promotions for low-performing categories to improve overall sales balance.


### 3. Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales :

Objective: Compare total sales across different outlets segmented by fat content.<br>
Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.

> ![Fat Content by Outlet](https://github.com/rishav197/Blinkit-Sales-Analytics-and-Dashboard/blob/main/Plots/fat_content_by_outlet.png)
>**Observation :** Across all outlet tiers, Low Fat items consistently generate higher sales compared to Regular items. Tier 3 outlets lead in overall sales, followed by Tier 2 and Tier 1. Blinkit can prioritize Low Fat product stocking across all outlet tiers, with special focus on Tier 3 outlets as they represent the highest sales potential.

### 4. Total Sales by Outlet Establishment :

Objective: Evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales.

> ![Fat Content by Outlet](https://github.com/rishav197/Blinkit-Sales-Analytics-and-Dashboard/blob/main/Plots/sales_by_outlet_establishment.png)
>**Observation :** Across all outlet tiers, 
Outlets established in 1998 achieved the highest sales (~204K), while those from 2011 recorded the lowest (~78K). Sales for outlets established after 2000 remain relatively stable in the 130K range, with only minor fluctuations. Older outlets (like 1998) demonstrate stronger sales performance, suggesting the value of brand trust and customer loyalty over time. Blinkit should focus on supporting newer outlets with marketing and customer engagement strategies to boost their sales.


### 5. Sales by Outlet Size :

Objective: Analyze the correlation between outlet size and total sales.

> ![Sales by Outlet Size](https://github.com/rishav197/Blinkit-Sales-Analytics-and-Dashboard/blob/main/Plots/sales_by_outlet_size.png)
>**Observation :** Medium-sized outlets contribute the highest sales (42.3%), followed by Small outlets (37.0%) and High outlets (20.7%). Despite having larger capacity, High outlets record the lowest sales share. Blinkit should strengthen marketing and customer engagement for High outlets to utilize their potential capacity, while continuing to leverage the strong performance of Medium and Small outlets for consistent revenue growth.


### 6. Sales by Outlet Location :
Objective: Assess the geographic distribution of sales across different locations.

> ![Sales by Outlet Location](https://github.com/rishav197/Blinkit-Sales-Analytics-and-Dashboard/blob/main/Plots/sales_by_outlet_location.png)
>**Observation :** Tier 3 outlets lead in sales (472,133), followed by Tier 2 (393,151) and Tier 1 (336,398). This highlights that smaller cities and towns contribute the most to overall sales, while metropolitan (Tier 1) outlets generate the least. Blinkit can strengthen its market share by focusing on Tier 3 outlets through better supply chain support and localized promotions. At the same time, there is an opportunity to revitalize sales in Tier 1 cities by introducing targeted campaigns and premium product offerings.


### 7. Sales by Item Visibility :

Objective: Understand how the visibility (shelf space/exposure) of items impacts total sales.
Additional KPI Metrics: Average Rating by visibility bucket.

> ![Sales by Item Visibility](https://github.com/rishav197/Blinkit-Sales-Analytics-and-Dashboard/blob/main/Plots/sales_by_item_visibility.png)
>**Observation :** Most products with low visibility (0–0.05) still generate a significant portion of sales, while higher visibility does not consistently translate to higher sales. Ratings appear fairly evenly distributed across all visibility levels, suggesting customer satisfaction is not strongly dependent on shelf exposure. Blinkit can focus on optimizing product quality and ratings rather than just increasing shelf space, as even low-visibility items can perform well. This indicates a strong opportunity to boost underexposed high-performing products through promotions or better placement strategies.



### 8. Sales by Outlet Type : 

Objective: Compare how different outlet types (Supermarket Type1, Grocery Store, etc.) contribute to total sales.
Additional KPI Metrics: Average Sales and Average Rating per outlet type.

Chart Type: Bar Chart.

### 9. Top 10 Selling Items :

Objective: Identify the best-performing items in terms of total sales.
Additional KPI Metrics: Average Rating of top-selling items.

Chart Type: Horizontal Bar Chart.
