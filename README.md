# Blinkit Sales Analytics and Dashboard


## Business Problem :

The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit’s sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. Using Power BI, the analysis will leverage key performance indicators (KPIs) and interactive visualizations to:

- Evaluate overall sales trends and revenue growth.
- Assess customer satisfaction levels and purchasing behavior.
- Analyze inventory distribution and product availability.
- Identify actionable insights and opportunities for business optimization.

This dashboard will enable stakeholders to make data-driven decisions for improving sales efficiency, enhancing customer experience, and optimizing inventory management.

<!-- Charts requirements -->
### 1. Total Sales by Fat Content :

Objective: Analyze the impact of fat content on total sales.<br>
Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.

> ![Sales by Fat Content](https://github.com/rishav197/Blinkit-Sales-Analytics-and-Dashboard/blob/main/Plots/sales_by_fat_content.png)
>**Observation :** Low Fat items account for 64.6% of total sales, while Regular items contribute 35.4%, showing a clear customer preference toward Low Fat products. Blinkit can focus inventory and marketing efforts on Low Fat products to maximize sales, while designing targeted promotions for Regular items to balance demand.


### 2. Total Sales by Item Type :

Objective: Identify the performance of different item types in terms of total sales.<br>
Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.

> ![Sales by Item Type](https://github.com/rishav197/Blinkit-Sales-Analytics-and-Dashboard/blob/main/Plots/sales_by_item_type.png)
>**Observation :** Sales are highly concentrated in a few categories — Fruits & Vegetables (178K) and Snack Foods (175K) lead, followed by Household (136K) and Frozen Foods (118K). Categories like Seafood (9K) and Breakfast (15K) contribute very little. Blinkit can prioritize high-demand categories to sustain revenue growth while considering targeted promotions for low-performing categories to improve overall sales balance.


### 3. Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales :

Objective: Compare total sales across different outlets segmented by fat content.<br>
Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.

> ![Fat Content by Outlet](https://github.com/rishav197/Blinkit-Sales-Analytics-and-Dashboard/blob/main/Plots/fat_content_by_outlet.png)
>**Observation :** Across all outlet tiers, Low Fat items consistently generate higher sales compared to Regular items. Tier 3 outlets lead in overall sales, followed by Tier 2 and Tier 1. Blinkit can prioritize Low Fat product stocking across all outlet tiers, with special focus on Tier 3 outlets as they represent the highest sales potential.
